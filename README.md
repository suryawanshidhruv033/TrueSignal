# TrueSignal 
**Semantic Talent Intelligence & OSINT Verification Engine**

TrueSignal is a production-grade hiring intelligence platform designed to eliminate "Resume Inflation" by verifying candidate claims against real-world digital footprints. Built for a high-intensity hackathon, it leverages semantic search, competitive programming APIs, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide an ungameable audit of technical talent.

##  Core Features

### 1. Holistic OSINT Verification 
TrueSignal doesn't just read resumes; it verifies them. It cross-references PDF claims against:
- **GitHub**: Evaluates repository distribution, commit density, and code quality.
- **LeetCode & Codeforces**: Fetches live competitive programming stats to verify algorithmic proficiency.
- **Identity Verification**: Flags discrepancies between resume links and provided social handles.

### 2. Glass-Box Audit (AI Reasoning) 
Traditional matching is a "black box." TrueSignal provides a **Glass-Box Audit** powered by **Groq LLaMA-3**:
- **HR Deep Analysis**: Career trajectory and mentorship potential evaluation.
- **Verified Skills Justification**: Each score is backed by specific evidence found in OSINT or the resume.
- **Critical Gaps**: Identifies exactly what the candidate is missing relative to the Job Description.

### 3. Enterprise RAG Talent Pool 
Store and query your entire applicant history semantically.
- **Persistent Vector Store**: Uses `SentenceTransformers` to index candidates.
- **Chat with your DB**: Ask questions like *"Who in our database has the strongest AWS experience?"* to retrieve the top matches instantly.

### 4. Zero-Mock Architecture 
- **No Hallucinations**: All fallback "mock data" has been removed. If a candidate cannot be verified, the system applies a **deterministic penalty** rather than inventing a score.
- **Anti-Bias Engine**: Aggressive anonymization strips names, gender, and demographics before the AI evaluates technical merit.

## 🛡️ Anti-Fake & Verification
TrueSignal implements a strict **Anti-Fake Multiplier**. Candidates with **zero verifiable OSINT footprint** (no GitHub, no LeetCode, no Codeforces) are penalized by **up to 60%**, surfacing only those who demonstrate their skills in the real world.
